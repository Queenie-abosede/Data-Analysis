🔍 Observations & Recommendations

1. Temporal Patterns:

Crimes are more frequent on Fridays and Saturdays, particularly midday to evening.

Targeted patrols during these periods could deter crime.



2. Location Focus:

Central, Southwest, and 77th Street divisions consistently report higher crime counts — should be focus areas for safety measures.



3. Crime Type Trends:

Theft and Assault-related crimes dominate; public education and neighborhood watch programs may reduce these offenses.



4. Gender Insights:

Males are slightly more affected, but both genders experience high victimization levels — tailored prevention awareness may help.



5. Future Work:

Integrate geo-mapping (using Power BI or Tableau) for spatial visualization.

Expand analysis to include crime resolution rates and suspect demographics.
